These assignments have been gratefully borrowed (along with the unit testing JS code)
from freecodecamp.org which is a wonderful site full of useful free code, videos, and
tutorials. Unfortunately the full "Responsive Web Design" curriculum
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/) is a bit too long for us to easily get all the way through in the more
limited amount of time we have. This is why we are using the htmlandcssguidebook.com as our main HTML/CSS tutorial this term. The notes below are from the FreeCodeCamp 
team that put together these docs and projects originally. Again, many thanks to 
everyone there for sharing their knowledge so freely!

"Hello Camper!

Please read the README below before beginning. Feel free to delete this message once you have read it. Good luck and Happy Coding! 

- The freeCodeCamp Team 

!! IMPORTANT README:

You may add additional external JS and CSS as needed to complete the project, however the <script> resource at the closing of the <body> tag below MUST remain in place for the tests to work.  

INSTRUCTIONS:
  - On the main page there is a little "hamburger" menu
    in the top left corner. This is where you will find
    the assignment's testing function.
  - Select the project you would 
    like to complete from the dropdown 
    menu, for CSCI6655-02-F21@UNH this will be
    either "Tribute Page" or "Survey Form" 
    depending on which one you are working on.
  - Click the "TESTS" button to run 
    the individual unit test cases against your project
    (they should all be failing at first).
  - Start coding! As you fulfill each
    test case by doing the Use Cases,
    you will see them go from red to green.
  - As you start to build out your 
    project, when tests are failing, 
    you should get helpful errors 
    along the way!

 PLEASE NOTE: Adding global style rules using the * selector, or by adding rules to body {..} or html {..}, or to all elements within body or html, i.e. h1 {..}, has the potential to pollute the test suite's CSS. Try adding: * { color: red }, for a quick example!

Once you have read the above messages, you can delete all these comments."
